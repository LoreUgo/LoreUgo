- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LoreUgo
- I'm an agronomist who is learning to code in R or Phyton. At the moment, I'm working on a DSS (decision support system) for helping the farmers to decide when and how much irrigate.
- If you want to talk about applying technologies in agriculture, let me know and we will discuss about it. You can reach me on my Linkedin profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-ugolini-001968250/
