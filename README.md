- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LoreUgo
- I'm an agronomist and I'm learning to code in R and Phyton. At the moment, I'm working on a DSS (decision support system) to help the farmers to decide when and how much to irrigate.
- If you want to talk about applying technologies in agriculture, let me know and we will discuss it. You can reach me on my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-ugolini-001968250/
